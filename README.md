# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Social-Media-Posts
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to analyze user-generated content from social media platforms. The goal is to classify posts into sentiment categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and extract actionable insights about customer opinions, brand perception, and trending topics.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140).  

## Features
Preprocessing of raw text (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).

Sentiment classification using Machine Learning models.

Visualization of sentiment distribution across posts.

Insights into customer feedback and trends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)

NLTK, Scikit-learn (NLP & ML)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Jupyter Notebook / Spyder (Development Environment)

## 📈 Results
Achieved accurate classification of sentiments across social media posts.

Model performance evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Visualizations demonstrate sentiment trends and distribution.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
Use deep learning models like LSTM, GRU, or BERT for better accuracy.

Expand dataset to include multilingual posts.

Deploy as a web application for real-time sentiment analysis.
